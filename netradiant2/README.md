1) What's this and why?
-----------------------

The original netradiant (from icculus.org) is good, but recently undeveloped.

The supposed new upstream at xonotic.org is developed, but it seems it recently rebased on 
top of the original gtkradiant, bringing back several bugs that were already fixed in 2008.

So this repo here consists of icculus.org netradiant + fixes, *not* rebased on top of the 
worse codebase.


2) Future plans?
----------------

Don't expect any new development here, unless I hit any new bugs myself ;)

This is merely here to serve as an offsite backup for the icculus.org netradiant + my fixes.

I expect that in a few years the unified radiant will be back at the top one spot, but right 
now, it has re-introduced far too many bugs. So I'll be using this branch here.


3) Contributing
---------------

Please work on top of the unified radiant and send your patches there.

Only if you too prefer to use this base, and hit a bug here, then send a pull request.
No new features should be added to this base.
